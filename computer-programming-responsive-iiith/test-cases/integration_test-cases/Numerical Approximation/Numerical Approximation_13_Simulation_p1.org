  - Data : 1,2,3,4,5

* Objective
  - To be able to simulate the  “Numerical Approximation” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/computer-programming-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Numerical Approximation/Numerical Approximation_01_Usability_smk.org][Numerical Approximation_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the “Simulation” link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Simulation page
  3. Enter the value of 'b' and don't enter the value of 'a'
  4. Click on OK button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be  displayed on the top of the screen
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. An error message should be displayed on the top of the screen as to enter the valid value 'a'

* Review/comments
