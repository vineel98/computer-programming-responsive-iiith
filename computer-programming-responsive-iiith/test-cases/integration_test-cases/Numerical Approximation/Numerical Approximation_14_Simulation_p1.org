  - Bandwidth : 100Mbps
  - Hardware Configuration:8GBRAM , 
  - Processor:i5
  - Data : 1,2,3,4,5

* Objective
  - To be able to simulate the  “Numerical Approximation” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/computer-programming-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Numerical Approximation/Numerical Approximation_01_Usability_smk.org][Numerical Approximation_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the “Simulation” link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Simulation page
  3. Enter the values of 'a' and 'b'
  4. Click on OK button, now click on start button to perform the simulation process
  5. Click on next button to perform the each simulation step till the last step
  6. Click on stop button 
  7. Click on start button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be  displayed on the top of the screen
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. When we click on OK button, If 'a' and 'b' values are valid , then start button should be enabled
  4. When we click on start button , the simulation process should start
  5. When we click on next button , next step simulation should perform and after completion of all the steps , the simulation result and simulation graph should be displayed on the the screen
  6. When we click on the stop button, the simulation process should stop and the entered values should be erased from the screen and the start button should be disabeled
