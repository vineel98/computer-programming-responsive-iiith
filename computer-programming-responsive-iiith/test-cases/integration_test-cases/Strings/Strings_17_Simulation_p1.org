  - Bandwidth : 100Mbps
  - Hardware Configuration:8GBRAM , 
  - Processor:i5
  - Data : @1,@#,A1

* Objective
  - To be able to simulate the  “Strings” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/computer-programming-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Strings/Strings_01_Usability_smk.org][Strings_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the “Simulation” link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Simulation page
  3. Select the 'string Matching' simulation
  4. Enter the values of '1st string' and '2nd string' 
  5. Click on OK button, now click on start button to perform the simulation process
  6. Click on next stringt button to perform the each simulation step till the last step
  7. Click on stop button 
  8. Change the type of code and repeat 4,5 and 6 steps again 
  9. Click on start button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be  displayed on the screen
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. It should redirect to the 'string Matching' simulation page
  4. When we click on OK button, If 'a' and 'b' values are valid , then start button should be enabled
  5. When we click on start button , the simulation process should start
  6. When we click on next button , next step simulation should perform and after completion of all the steps , the simulation result and simulation graph should be displayed on the screen
  7. When we click on the stop button, the simulation process should stop and the entered values should be erased from the screen and the start button should be disabeled
