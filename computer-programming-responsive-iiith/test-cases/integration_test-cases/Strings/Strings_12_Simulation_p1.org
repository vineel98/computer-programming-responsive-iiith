* Objective
  - To be able to simulate the  “Strings” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/computer-programming-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Strings/Strings_01_Usability_smk.org][Strings_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the “Simulation” link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Simulation page
  3. Select the 'string comparision' simulation
  4. Enter values in 1st string field and don't enter values in 2nd string field and vice-versa
  5. Click on OK button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be  displayed on the screen
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. It should redirect to the 'string comparision' simulation page
  4. An error message should be displayed on the screen as to enter the 2nd string vlaue and vice-versa
