  - Bandwidth : 100Mbps
  - Hardware Configuration:8GBRAM , 
  - Processor:i5
  - Data : 1,2,3,4,5

* Objective
  - To be able to simulate the  “Advanced Control Flow” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/computer-programming-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Advanced Control Flow/Advanced Control Flow_01_Usability_smk.org][Advanced Control Flow_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the “Simulation” link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Simulation page
  3. Enter the value in number for calculating P! field
  4. Click on start button to perform the simulation process
  5. Click on next button to perform the each simulation step till the last step
  6. Click on switch to nested loop button 
  7. Enter a value in height of pyramid field and click on start button
  8. Click on next button to perform the each simulation step till the last step
  9. Click on switch to simple loop button
  10. Repeat 3,4,5,6,7,8 steps again

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be  displayed on the screen
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. When we click on OK button, If 'a' and 'b' values are valid , then start button should be enabled
  4. When we click on start button , the simulation process should start
  5. When we click on next button , next step simulation should perform and after completion of all the steps , the simulation result and simulation graph should be displayed on the screen
  6. When we click on the switch to nested loop button, the simulation process should stop and nested loop simulation screen should be displayed
  7. When we click on start button , the simulation process should start
  8. When we click on next button , next step simulation should perform and after completion of all the steps , the simulation result and simulation graph should be displayed on the screen
  9. When we click on the switch to simple loop button, the simulation process should stop and nested loop simulation screen should be displayed
