* Objective
  - To be able to simulate the  “Pointers” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/computer-programming-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Pointers/Pointers_01_Usability_smk.org][Pointers_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the “Simulation” link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Simulation page
  3. Select the 'Call by reference' simulation
  4. Click on start button and click on next button
  5. Click on back button and then click on next button till the last step

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be  displayed on the screen
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. It should redirect to the 'Call by reference' simulation page 
  4. When we click on start button , the simulation process should start
  5. When we click on the vback button , the simulation should go to the previous step
  6. When we click on next button , next step simulation should perform and after completion of all the steps , the simulation result should be displayed on the screen
