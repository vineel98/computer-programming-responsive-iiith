  - Bandwidth : 100Mbps
  - Hardware Configuration:8GBRAM , 
  - Processor:i5
  - Data : 1,2,3,4,5

* Objective
  - To be able to simulate the  “Arrays” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/computer-programming-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Arrays/Arrays_01_Usability_smk.org][Arrays_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the “Simulation” link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Simulation page
  3. Select 1-D array simulation 
  4. Enter the value in Array Size! field
  5. Click on OK button and choose the type of generating the random values as manual 
  6. and enter the values in the box present above the start button with comma/space separated between the numbers
  7. Click on start button to perform the simulation process
  8. Click on next button to perform the each simulation step till the last step

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be  displayed on the screen
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. When we click on OK button, If 'value in Array Size field is valid , then start button should be enabled
  4. When we click on start button , the simulation process should start
  5. When we click on next button , next step simulation should perform and after completion of all the steps , the simulation result should be displayed on the screen
