* Objective
  - To be able to simulate the  “Basic Control Flow” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/computer-programming-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Basic Control Flow/Basic Control Flow_01_Usability_smk.org][Basic Control Flow_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the “Simulation” link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Simulation page
  3. Select the 'If condition' simulation
  4. Enter the values of 'X' and 'Y' and don't select the type of code either if-else or if-else-if
  5. Click on OK button,

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be  displayed on the screen
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. It should redirect to the 'if condition' simulation page
  4. When we click on OK button, an error message should be displayed on the screen as to select the type of code
