* Objective
  - To be able to simulate the  “Basic Control Flow” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/computer-programming-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Basic Control Flow/Basic Control Flow_01_Usability_smk.org][Basic Control Flow_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the “Simulation” link 
  2. Check if there are any distortions and junk characters in the Simulation page
  3. Select the 'Switch condition' simulation
  4. Enter day number in the corresponding field and click on OK button
  5. Click on start button to start the simulation process
  6. Click on the next to perform the simulation for each step till the last step
  7. Repeat 4,5 and 6 steps again

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be  displayed on the screen
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. It should redirect to the 'if condition' simulation page 
  4. The simulation result should be displayed on the screen

* Review/comments
